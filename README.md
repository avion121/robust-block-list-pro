## Notes
- This single file intentionally mixes adblock rules and domain/host entries as you requested.
- If you use this file for DNS-level blockers (Pi-hole, AdGuard Home) be aware that adblock rules and element-hiding lines are not meaningful in DNS contexts — they will remain as comments/rules in this single file. For best compatibility, consider generating separate domain-only and rule-only exports in addition to this merged file.
- fetch_errors.log contains any fetch failures (404/timeout/non-text responses) for debugging.
