üö´ Robust Block List Pro
Robust Block List Pro is the ultimate, enterprise-grade blocklist aggregator designed to deliver a faster, safer, and more private browsing experience. Every day at 05:00 UTC, our GitHub Actions workflow aggregates 65+ best-in-class feeds covering ads, trackers, malware, phishing, cryptojacking, annoyances, and more. It deduplicates entries, filters potential secrets, and generates a lean, battle-tested robust_block_list_pro.txt compatible with uBlock Origin, AdGuard, Pi-hole, and other DNS-level blockers.
