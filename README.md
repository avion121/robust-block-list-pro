Installation

Clone or Download:git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git


Install Python 3:Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Install Dependencies:pip install requests


Run the Script:python generate_list.py

This generates robust_block_list_pro.txt in the repository root.

Usage

uBlock Origin / AdBlock Plus:
Open your ad blocker’s settings.
Add the URL to the generated list:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/main/robust_block_list_pro.txt


Update filters to apply.


Pi-hole / AdGuard Home:
Add the list URL to your blocklist sources in the admin interface.
Update gravity or refresh to apply.
Note: Convert hosts-format entries (e.g., 127.0.0.1 domain) to domains if needed for DNS-based blockers.


Hosts File:Append the contents of robust_block_list_pro.txt to your system’s hosts file (e.g., /etc/hosts on Linux, C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts on Windows), ensuring proper formatting.

Automation
The list is updated daily at 5:00 AM UTC via a GitHub Actions workflow (update-robust-block-list-pro.yml). To set up automation in your repository:

Ensure a Personal Access Token (PAT) with repo scope is stored in your repository’s secrets as PAT_TOKEN.
The workflow checks out the repo, runs generate_list.py, and commits changes to robust_block_list_pro.txt if updates are detected.

Contributing
We welcome contributions to make Robust Block List Pro even more ULTIMATE! To contribute:

Add New Sources: Suggest high-quality, low-false-positive block lists via issues or pull requests. Include the URL, category, and rationale.
Improve the Script: Enhance generate_list.py (e.g., add hosts-to-ABP conversion, logging, or error retries).
Report Issues: Open an issue for false positives, broken sources, or script errors.
Fork, modify, and submit a pull request with clear descriptions of changes.

Notes

Performance: With over 70 sources, the list is massive. Test for false positives (e.g., legitimate sites breaking) and optimize for your tool’s limits (e.g., Pi-hole’s gravity size).
Format Compatibility: The script mixes ABP-style (||domain^) and hosts-style (127.0.0.1 domain) entries. For DNS blockers, you may need to parse hosts entries into domain lists.
Testing: Always test updates in a controlled environment before deploying to production systems.
